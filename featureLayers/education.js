It is sometimes called \"The Statue of Three Lies\" because it is not actually John Harvard (no picture existed, so sculptor Daniel Chester french used a friend as a model), it lists John Harvard as the founder of the University (he wasn't), and it says he founded Harvard in 1638 (Harvard was founded in 1636). Students involve the statue in various pranks and antics every year, but perhaps the worst is the one that is ongoing - it is a student tradition to urinate on John Harvard's brass foot; many tourists are under the impression that it is lucky to rub that foot. The statue was originally sited by Memorial Hall and later moved to this site.\u00A0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/ALX7VA3lOCIfTZbLWEiiDzuEjEDVDGCIsY_dyYTSuWbiZrpPioDfVRzQD_a0PFJnm6UEYhk5GFslT4DM2cUcinM2J7CNxkCJRNTERDE0xkgkj_JvD_gdt7egllpS_as2eqXwLjJP9snnDLoIcLXb\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /\u003e"

Built with a gift from Eleanor Elkins Widener, it is a memorial to her son, Harry (Class of 1907), an enthusiastic young book collector who died on the Titanic with his father. Harry had spoken of donating his personal book collection to the University once it replaced the outdated and inadequate library then located in Gore Hall. Mrs. Widener followed through on this, building a facility of monumental proportions, with over 50 miles of shelves and room for over three million volumes. As Mrs. Widener stipulated, Harry Widener's personal collection occupies its own room in the center of the library, untouched, with fresh cut flowers and an encased copy of the Gutenberg bible (a later gift from the family). There is a common myth that Mrs. Widener insisted that all Harvard students be required to pass a swimming test - this is not true. The library opened in 1915, but Harvard's collection continued to grow so fast that Widener was filled to capacity by the late 1930s. Space was at a premium, and a lengthy decentralization, with numerous departmental libraries and special collections, became a reality. Today, Harvard has over 70 libraries, but Widener remains the \"main\" library.
